<!-- INTRODUCTION -->

<p> This page is a official resource for data and information related to 
the Quasar Luminosity Function from Data Release Nine in the 
SDSS-III Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, the published paper of which 
is <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...773...14R">Ross et al. (2013)</a>.
