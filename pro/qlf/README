For the Stripe 82 data/results, 
    e.g., My_QLF_iband_boss_narrowZ_S82_McGkcor.dat, 
you don't want to actually correct the data in anyway 
with the selection function and hence: 
    > diff My_QLF_iband_boss_temp.dat          My_QLF_iband_boss_S82_McGkcor.dat  
    > diff My_QLF_iband_boss_narrowZ_temp.dat  My_QLF_iband_boss_narrowZ_S82_McGkcor.dat 
doesn't give anything...


N.B. You have to select in the qlf_iband.pro code:
the completeness_level in order to make the e.g. S82
measurements:
	completeness_level = 0.85  ;; for DR9 at 0.85 completeness
	completeness_level = 82    ;; for Stripe 82...


 K-correction files

-rw-r--r--@ 1 npr1  staff   7910 Apr 15 17:19 kcorr_Miz2_mcgreer_rescaleFe.dat

kcorr_Miz2_mcgreer_1210.6389v1.dat (453 lines long, 3 lines of header) used in 1210.6389v1.
kcorr_Miz2_mcgreerV2 and _short, are for the "least perturbation model", but currently
		     		 don't have the correct delta_z binning. 
kcorr_Miz2_mcgreer_rescaleFe.dat is another "v2" and is from the email from IDMcG on Apr 10, 2013, 7:01 PM. 
				    and has an "Fe emission template is relatively stronger (as Gordon noted)."
				    and gives rise to kcorr_compare_rescaleFe.png

   qlf_plot_iband_bossrange.pro   (also in ../../plot/qlf/)

and 
    kcorr_Miz2_mcgreer_R06spliced.dat
(with a "d" !!!!) for the K-correction. 

N.B. the "rv1" files 
     e.g. My_QLF_iband_boss_wgt_McGkcor_rv1.dat
that are *in* this directory have the spliceD k-corr. 
cf. those in the My_QLF/ directory which have the splice.dat k-correction.


for the formatted files:
    My_QLF_iband_boss_wgt_formatted4paper_temp.dat  (is the output file...)

    QLF_iband_boss_wgt_formatted4paper_McGkcor_rv1.dat

 *nar*  files...
========================================

   QLF_iband_boss_narrowZ_formatted4paper_5731_tozeq4.dat	
has, unsurprisingly, 5731 total(Nq) from 179 valid lines read. 
These have 2.20<z<3.836. 
There are 164 enteries with 2.20<z<3.50 and total(Nq) here
is now, 5476.

   QLF_iband_boss_narrowZ_formatted4paper_S82.dat has the same specs as
"5371_tozeq4.dat" above, as in: total(NQ_full) = 5731, with 2.20<z<3.836
from 179 lines, and total(NQ_full[w]) = 5476 with 2.20<z<3.50 and N= 164. 
BUT!!!
DEFINITELY HAS DIFFERENT PHI VALUES!!! 

  QLF_iband_boss_wgt_formatted4paper_S82 is the "sister" to the immediately
above file, in that it comes from the very same data and calculation, (and
has all the same Nq etc.) numbers, it's just now in the 3 regular redshift bins. 


   My_QLF_iband_boss_S82_March2012 
has 6206 Nq over 2.01<z<4.75 and 
has 5678 Nq over 2.40<z<4.25. 

   My_QLF_iband_boss_S82_McGkcor.dat
has, 5732.00 total(Nq) from 81 valid lines with 2.40<z<4.25 and
     5476.00 total(Nq) from 65 valid lines with 2.20<z<3.50.
