Hi Nic-

Here, as promised, are selection functions derived from the models. Just in
brief: they have the W&P11 forest model, emission lines from the Van den
Berk template, and both have a continuum distribution of -1.5 +/- 0.3
blueward of LyAlpha. "modelA" then has -0.5 +/- 0.3 redward, while "expdust"
has -0.17 +/- 0.22, but with a distribution of SMC dust that goes like
exp(-E[B-V]/0.033). That distribution seems to fit the red tail well (I was
rather excited about this until I discovered it appeared in a Phil Hopkins
paper, though no one (including me, sadly) seems to have noticed as far as I
can tell). I think "expdust" is a better prescription, whereas "modelA"
matches Richards+06 more closely.

Also, the files with "PQSOMIDZ" use the mid-z probabilities, obviously,
whereas the others use the PQSO. It's sort of fun to blink the completeness
maps and see the changes. Surprisingly, the dusty model *increases* the
selection function, which I'm looking into, but if correct means that the
dusty model is better, since it matches what XDQSO does. Interesting...

I'll be around tomorrow but then travel/observing etc.

Cheers
-Ian
