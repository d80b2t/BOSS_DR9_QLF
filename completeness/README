/cos_pc19a_npr/BOSS/QLF/completeness


This is directory where I'll keep my notes, 
but more usefully Ian's code/plots etc. for 
the completeness checks. 

First Question: is there a difference here between
"Completeness" and the "Selection Function"?? 
I guess there is, but this is more an issue of
one just being the inverse of t'other...?
