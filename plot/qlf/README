I'm pretty/very sure that the files:
    chi_sq_PLE_model_McG_2.2z3.5.dat
and 
    chi_sq_loglinear_LEDE_model_McG_2.2z3.5.dat
were generated on my "old" MacBook Pro (since I currently)
can't "printf" in IDL demo mode...) sometime close or around 
11th/12th March 2013. These should come directly from 
the IDMcG fits given in Table 1 of BOSS_QLF_rv1.



Fig. 12 in http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.6389v1 is:
     QLF_selfunc_divfid_noS82_McGkcor.ps
and uses:
    ../../pro/qlf/My_QLF_iband_boss_wgt_McGkcor.dat
    ../../pro/qlf/My_QLF_iband_boss_wgt_fiducial_grid.dat
    ../../pro/qlf/My_QLF_iband_boss_wgt_expdust.dat 

Slightly, (very!) confusingly, recall that the "fiducial_grid" model, 
is actually the old(er) VdB lines model, with the "McGkcor" model being the
one that is "fiducial_linetweak_grid_i_sel.txt" in the ~/QLF/completeness 
directory.
