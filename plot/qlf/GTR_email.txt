Nic et al.

Here's a quick summary of my thoughts on the magnitude conversion stuff.

First, for a spectral index of alpha_nu=-0.5, the following is true:
L_i > L_g
M_i < M_g
m_i < m_g  (consistent with g-i~0.25)

Then, generically (for an AB to AB conversion):
M_XXXX = M_YYYY + 2.5*alpha_nu*log(XXXX/YYYY)
for XXXX, YYYY in wavelength units

if XXXX<YYYY, then M_XXXX > M_YYYY since the right-hand term is positive.
So, M_g > M_i.  Check.

For Mi(z=2) we *define* the K-correction to be zero at z=2. Normally the
K-correction would be:
K = -2.5*(1+alpha_nu)*log(1+z)
which for z=2 is
-0.596

So, we have to add 0.596 to the K-correction.  Thus Table 4 in R+06 is correct.
However, Equation 1 is *wrong*.  There I added 0.596 to the absolute magnitude,
not the K-correction.  Since the K-correction comes in with a negative sign,
the sign here is wrong.  The correct equation is

Mi(z=2) = Mi(z=0) + 0.596
or
Mi(z=0) = Mi(z=2) - 0.596

Indeed, we can check this using the formula above as this definition
is equivalent to shifting the effective wavelength of the i-band to
2490.33 Angstroms.  So,

Mi(z=2) = Mi(z=0) + 2.5*alpha_nu*log(7471/3/7471)
       = Mi(z=0) + 2.5*alpha_nu*log(2490.33/7471)
   = Mi(z=0) + 2.5*alpha_nu*log(1/(1+2))
       = Mi(z=0) + 0.596

Fortunately, for all of the analysis in the paper, it looks like what
I actually did was correct.

But this does have ramifications for Equation 3, here
M_1450 = Mi(z=0) + 2.5*alpha_nu*log(1450/7471)
so the _form_ of this is correct, but with the Equation 1 being wrong,
the substitution is incorrect.  The correct equation is

M_1450 = Mi(z=2) - 0.596 + 2.5*alpha_nu*log(1450/7471)
or
M_1450 = Mi(z=2) + 2.5*alpha_nu*log(1450/2490.33)

So that
M_1450 = Mi(z=2) + 0.294

Checking:

Mi(z=2) has an effective wavelength of 2490.33 and 1450 isn't that far
from 2490, so the offset can't be too large.  The sign is also correct
as M_1450 > M_2490.33


I haven't looked into the conversion from B_J or R yet, but any Vega
to AB system can have a much larger correction depending on the AB mag
of Vega at the effective wavelength.  So, I can't yet say whether the
conversion to M_1450 in Croom et al. 2009 are correct or not.

I'll have to look to see what ramifications this has for any of the
curves in Figures 19 and 20 (i.e. those derived from M_1450).

But, note that
 M_{1450, AB}  =  M_i(z=2) - 0.98
is clearly wrong as it both has the wrong sign and the value is too large
for a correction only going from 2490A to 1450A.x
